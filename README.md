# LockerBox
Locker Box is a secure, menu-driven file encryption and decryption tool for Windows that lets you protect, hide, and manage your files with ease. Built for convenience, it allows you to encrypt files with a password, decrypt them when needed, and store them in a hidden vault accessible only with your master password.
